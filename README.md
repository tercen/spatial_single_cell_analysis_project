# Nearest Neighbour
- There is a single `.zip` file from three patients.

# Project
- The user has a single-cell `.csv` file from three patients.
- The goal is to perform dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and clustering (Phenograph), which I believe are already implemented in Tercen.
- The **analysis** involves using the spatial coordinates (X, Y) from the single-cell data to perform neighborhood analysis.
- The output file should include columns for UMAP, Phenograph, and Cell Neighborhood results, appended to the original single-cell `.csv` file.
